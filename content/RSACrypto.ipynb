    "## RSA Cryptography: An application of modular arithmetics\n",
    "\n",
    "   The word **cryptography** comes from two Greek words: *kryptós*, which means \"hidden\", and *graphein*, which means \"to write\". Therefore, it refers to the practice of developing and studying techniques to secure information. Civilization has had the necessity to hide and protect information since ancient times: the first occurences of encrypted information have been found in Egypt, and date back to 1000 B.C. \n",
    "\n",
    "   Throughout the last centuries, cryptography evolved into a complex field within Mathematics and Computer Science. Currently, cryptography algorithms seek to guarantee four principals in regards to manipulating and sending encrypted information:\n",
    "    \n",
    "   **1 - Confidentiality:** The encrypted information can only be accessed by the recipient and no one else.\n",
    "   \n",
    "   **2 - Integrity:** The encyption algorithm and the pathway between the sender and recipient must not alter the original information.\n",
    "   \n",
    "   **3 - Non-repudiation:** The sender must not stay anonymous. It must be possible to track the sender of the encrypted message.\n",
    "   \n",
    "   **4 - Authentication:** The identities of the sender and the recipient must be safely confirmed.\n",
    "   \n",
    "### What constitutes a cryptographic algorithm?\n",
    "\n",
    "   Currently, there two main types of cryptographic algorithms: **assymetric cryptography and symmetric cryptography**. These two classifications differentiate themselves in the use of encryption keys. In cryptography, a key is a piece of information that is used in the algorithm to encrypt or decrpyt the message. The use of keys guarantee authetication and confidentiality. The original information is known as plaintext, and the encrypted information is known as ciphertext. \n",
    "   \n",
    "   **Symmetric cryptography:** Symmetric cryptography establishes that the sender and recipient share the same key. The key is a shared secret between the sender and the recipient. This guarantees **confidentiality**, because only the person who has the same key as the sender can decrypt the ciphertext. **Non-repudiation** is also guaranteed, because the recipient knows that sender has the same key. **Authetication** is present, because only the shared key verifies the the sender's and the recipient's identities. Finally, the shared key allows the recipient to verify if the pathway or the algorithm altered the original message, guaranteeing **integrity**. \n",
    "   \n",
    "   Although symmetric cryptography seems to be the most intuitive form of cryptographic algorithms, it creates another security problem: it is difficult to create a safe way to share the key between the sender and the recipient. If the sender's or recepient's information is intercepted by a third party somehow, it is possible to discover the key and decrypt the ciphertext. Attacks towards symmetric cryptography algorithms use this strategy: known-plaintext attacks are conducted by attackers who have access to the specific plaintext and the final ciphertext. By analizing the two different information carefully, it maybe possible to discover the key.\n",
    "   \n",
    "   Furthermore, symmetric cryptography ideally demands that each sender-recipient pair have their own key. If the sender is connected to various different recipients, and each one has their own key, the complexity of the key mangemant environment increases greatly, making it even harder to assure safety. \n",
    "   \n",
    "   **Asymmetric cryptography:** Given the problems related to key security in symmetric cryptography, American mathematicians and cryptographers Whitfield Diffie and Martin Hellman proposed in 1976 the public key cryptography system, also known as asymmetric cryptography. In this scenario, instead of the key itself being the shared secret between the sender and the recepient, each one of the parties involved has two keys: a public key (which is known to everyone and guarantees **non-repudiation**) and a private key (which is kept secret and allows **confidentiality** and **authetication**). Both keys are used to encrypt and decrypt. If plaintext is encrypted using a sender's public key, only the sender's private key will be able to decrpyt it. If plaintext is encrypted with the sender's private key, only the sender's public key wil decrypt it. This adds a second layer of safety, because truly confidential information is necessary to obtain information, assuring **integrity**.  \n",
    "   \n",
    "   \n",
    "### What is RSA Cryptography?\n",
    "\n",
    "   Just a few years after the assymetric cryptography system was proposed, MIT mathematicians Ron Rivest, Adi Shamir and Leonard Adleman elaborated their own cryptographic algorithm. \n",
    "   \n",
    "   Interestingly, the premise of RSA Chryptography was firstly anounced by British mathematician William Stanley Jevons little more than 100 years before the creation of the RSA algorithm. In his 1874 book *The Principles of Science*, he wrote: \n",
    "   \"Can the reader say what two numbers multiplied together will produce the number 8616460799? I think it unlikely that anyone but myself will ever know.\"\n",
    "   \n",
    "   The idea behind the usage of public and private keys is similar to the one anounced by William Stanley Jevons: the public and private keys create a unique combination for each sender and recipient. \n",
    "   \n",
    "### The Algorithm\n",
    "    \n",
    "   The algorithm uses two main principals of number arithmetic and field theory: prime numbers and modular arithmetics.\n",
    "    \n",
    "   **Key Generation:** \n",
    "   \n",
    "   1 - Select two very large prime numbers. Those will be called *p* and *q*.  \n",
    "   \n",
    "   2 - Compute *n = p.q*.\n",
    "   \n",
    "   3 - Compute Euler Totient Function &Phi;$(n) = (p-1)(q-1)$. This is an interesting function, which reveals the amount of numbers that are coprime to *p* and *q*.\n",
    "   \n",
    "   4 - Choose a number *e* that must be relatively prime to &Phi;$(n)$. Those two numbers constitute the public key. \n",
    "   \n",
    "   5 - Compute the modular inverse of *e* to the modulus of &Phi;$(n)$. That number will be called *d* and is the private key.\n",
